FIRST, create the UI with following elements:
<div> to display the Student's name (name), 
number of joined classes (classCount), and
information about the student being (or not) in the Class (inClass)

<form> with one input field (Student's name) and one button (save student name)
<button> that says either Join the class or Leave the class (depends on inClass)
